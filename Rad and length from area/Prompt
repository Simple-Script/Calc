Create a script that can solve triangle or rectangle from area if the prompt is like height is 3 times the base the script should ask triangle or rect then ask for area. Then base or height is smaller. The smaller num is first then how many times larger is the larger num e.g square area is 18 the height is 3 times the base or the base is 3 times the height. For triangle e.g. are is 27 and height is 3 times base or base is three times height. The answer should be in simplest radical form for triangle and values/nums for square/rectangle. Write for TI 84 plus ce py
