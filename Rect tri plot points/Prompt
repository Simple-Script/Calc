Create a script that finds the perimeter and area of a triangle or rectangle off of points on a graph, the script should ask “triangle or rectangle?” Then the user can select rectangle or triangle. The next question is “points or values?” Then the user will select their option. For rectangle the user will input the points of the base and height e.g x1=3 y1=5 x2=5 y2=7 for base and x1=4 y1=6 x2=7 y2=9 For height. The script would calculate the area of the rectangle on the graph and list the perimeter and area. For a triangle it would be similar. There are three sides so the script would ask for three xs and ys. Then it would list the area and perimeter in the answer. Write this for ti 84 plus ce in python
How does the values work? Does it specify base height and hypotenuse? I want it to ask if it’s a right triangle or irregular (obtuse or acute) I should be able to just type the value of the sides e.g. b=10 h=5 hypotenuse=7
